# Ikimina Digital – Hackathon Pitch

## Problem
Millions of people rely on informal savings groups (Ikimina / ROSCA).
These systems suffer from fraud, lack of transparency, and limited reach.

## Solution
Ikimina Digital uses Stellar and Soroban smart contracts to automate group savings and payouts without trust in a central authority.

## Why Stellar
- Low transaction fees
- Fast global payments
- Strong support for financial inclusion
- Ideal for diaspora remittances

## Why Soroban
- Secure smart contracts
- On-chain rule enforcement
- Transparency for all members

## Impact
- Financial inclusion
- Community empowerment
- Cross-border savings groups

## Hackathon Goal
Deliver a working Soroban-based savings contract and demo frontend on Stellar testnet.
